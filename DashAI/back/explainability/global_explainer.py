    Global explainers analyse the behaviour of a trained model across an entire
    dataset, producing explanations that describe which features are most
    influential *on average* (as opposed to local explainers, which explain a
    single prediction). Typical outputs include feature-importance rankings,
    partial dependence curves, or aggregate attribution scores.

    All concrete global explainers must implement :meth:`explain` (compute the
    explanation from a dataset) and :meth:`plot` (serialise the explanation as
    Plotly figures for the frontend).

        Parameters
        ----------
        dataset : Tuple[DatasetDict, DatasetDict]
            A two-element tuple ``(x, y)`` where ``x`` contains the input
