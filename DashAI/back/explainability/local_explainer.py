    Local explainers explain individual predictions: given a single input example,

    Unlike global explainers (which average over the full dataset), local
    explanations can reveal why the model made a particular decision for a
    specific sample and can differ substantially from sample to sample.

    Concrete implementations must provide :meth:`fit` (prepare background data or
    internal state), :meth:`explain_instance` (compute per-instance attributions),
